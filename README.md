# SecondRideShare
Before Ruby on Rails Ride Share Project 

A little bit about the learning goals in this exercise: 
- Reinforce and practice Ruby programming fundamentals, particularly
- Creating and instantiating classes with attributes
- Using composition to connect different classes together
- Working with files and large amounts of data
- Writing pseudocode and creating tests to drive the creation of our code
- Quickly become familiar with a large and complex code base
- Use inheritance to extend existing classes
